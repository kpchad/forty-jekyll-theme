I am currently developing at OpticSurg, a startup creating an Augmented Reality software platform that surgeons can use in real time to do their jobs better, minimize complications, and save lives.

OpticSurg recently achieved their proof of concepts, primary prototype, and is entering the next round of funding to create an MVP.
