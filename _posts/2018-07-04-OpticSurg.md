I am currently doing augmented reality devleopment at OpticSurg, a startup creating an Augmented Reality software platform that surgeons can use in real time to do their jobs better, minimize complications, and save lives. Some of my contributions at OpticSurg include prototype development, user testing, user interviews, interface design, grant writing, and regulatory research.
